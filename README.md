Our planet is threatened today. Fires, factories, glaciers, hurricanes, tornados, sea levels, drought, crisis after crisis--every day we witness nature slowly slip away.

We all know the answer: sustainability. But what does it mean to be more sustainable? Does it mean we must install solar panels, buy organic/fair trade food, and all buy electric cars?

These are traditional answers to living a more sustainable life. But what of those who cannot afford a $10,000 solar panel, or an $80,000 Tesla, or even a $10 head of lettuce? What of the marginalized, the poor, the people who, according to the US Department of Economic & Social Affairs, are hurt the most by climate change?

Homely seeks to change that.

Homely democratizes sustainability. 

Users submit photos of their homes, and they receive feedback from people all over the world on how to make their home more sustainable. The National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine estimates that we could reduce home energy consumption by 30% through residential energy efficiency efforts. The only thing holding us back is access to that information; Homely solves that.

 Reviewers browse 3D VR reconstructions of peoples homes and give feedback on how to make their homes more sustainable.
